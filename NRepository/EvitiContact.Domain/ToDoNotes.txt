1. Try adding internal or protected items to the entity items set and then use "Domain Services" to update the properties
    The though here would be to not allow any items outside the assembly to 'set' values
    You could then follow DDD easer and still use code generation

2. Change external list to IReadOnlyList

3. Fix global validation handling to us the API response to format API validation errors
